There's a scene at the end of a long-forgotten movie, "Angel Heart," where the devil schools a private detective about his true identity and the things he did. The movie closes with the detective's long ride down to hell in an elevator.

The whole film is about figuring out the strange happenings and coincidences occurring during the investigation. In the end, the detective's true self and actions are revealed, to his disbelief.

In my life, and in moments when I've suffered the most from my condition, I've often felt like that detective. There's something that operates inside of me, almost entirely independent of what I am and think. There's no simple explanation for it except to say that it makes me suffer. It tends to make me feel disproportiate humiliation and embarassment in social situations.

The worst part is that, like the detective, it's me who pays the price. The detective may not have been aware of his actions and feelings, but it was he who had to ride the elevator down.

I created this blog to document my perceptions and sufferings. It's a lonely exercise, much like my condition, but I'm at a stage in my life where I'm able to understand some things. I've been through years of therapy, to little avail, and don't feel it would be useful (unless I were to find a therapist specializing in this condition).

I'm given to understand the only hope for people like me is to learn to cope with the disorder, as [I'll never be "cured"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder) (a prognosis I agree with based on my experiences).

Let me state for the record that I'm self-diagnosed, and it could well be I have a similar, but different condition. I'll reveal in this blog why I now believe I have this condition, and how AvPD ymptoms that I've read about are strikingly close to my own.

Let me also state I consider myself somewhat highly functioning - I'm able to get out and hold a job. People who meet or know me consider me to be somewhat of an introvert and maybe even a loner, but they would be shocked to learn I have a personality disorder (as my wife was shocked).

In contrast my brother (who has similar symptoms) is unable and unwilling to hold a job and lives entirely as a hermit does, with no social contact with anyone whatsoever.

I hope this blog will serve the purpose of helping me analyze and cope better with my disorder, and that along the way someone might find it useful
