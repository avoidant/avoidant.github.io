  Getting old is an unpleasant experience for most people but is a hallmark of
  every life lived long and therefore successfully. Like death, coping with old
  age is different and personal for everyone.

Getting old is a process that creeps up and takes you unawares. I'm now 48 and can say with certainty that 45 was the year I became old (i.e., switched adjectives from "young" to "old" in reference to myself). Since "old" is an adjective few prefer to describe themselves as, it's often up to the environment to give you this label before you reluctantly accept it. And by "reluctant" I mean with nearly a scientific approach corroborated by evidence. If you have a family with kids you may get called old and laugh it off, but then you wake up the next morning with this amazing pain in your upper back and remember the words a friend told you years ago: "the body wasn't made for a life past 40."

The path to growing old is replete with denial and cognitive dissonance, the more so if you lived youth with any number of crutches relating to your own looks or on youth itself (as ego boosters in uncomfortable situations). In other words, getting old can be painful in itself from a psychological standpoint, especialyl when you finally must let go of the crutches. In my teenage years I was told I was "good looking" at various times and while my condition precluded me from a vibrant social life and the partners/girlfriends that come with that, I always convinced myself that any social rejection encountered was not because I was conventionally ugly. Of course this was always a near-useless sop to my main issue of believing something is inherently wrong with me, something that is obvious in my appearance but cannot quite pin down and understand it.
