  Most of my problem with AvPD was the simple fact I couldn't even see it.
  Denial of your true self also has high costs.

Imagine being stricken with something that you not only don't understand, but can't even see. Something bothers you so much you start needing to imagine you're someone else, someone better. Soon you start to think those fantasies are actually real and you forget the wound. You thought you had it together and build an entire worldview on sand. Until something reaches out of you, a big grey claw, at an inopportune moment to assault that worldview and embarass the living daylights out of you. Maybe this happens when you're at lunch with your boss and let slip a pointed insult at him, jabbing him in his most sensitive area. He looks at you stunned. You quickly glance at him and then back at your plate. You can feel your face growing red. Yes indeedy... that comment came straight out of your mouth and none other.

No one else can see it either, even the people you're paying to help you. They only encourage you talk about it, maybe offer to pump your system with Prozac and Xanax. You talk and talk and talk. For years. Talking relieves some of the symptoms and offers perspective. At times you believe you're really "cured" when you feel better during certain periods, maybe when you've fallen in love or have found a good workplace environment where you can work at home a few days a week.

But in fact your issues can never be cured. They're built into your operating system, and to get rid of it you'd need to get rid of your brain. So deeply embedded is your sickness that the only closure you'll ever get is temporary relief. Many moments of your existance will be filled with discomfort, pain, and fear.

## My blindness

Personally it took me till middle age to even begin to frame my problem. Slowly I've come to realize the utter pervasiveness of it, how is saturates every pore of my perception and skews my understanding of the world. It's a problem the scale of which I could never imagine.

How can anyone cope with such a problem? You know, even as I need to focus on my issues in order to better cope with them, I feel a great longing for relief sometimes, a little break from my discomfort (that's what my artificial worldview was shielding me from, an existance of low-grade discomfort bordering on nausea). Sometimes I tell myself it's ok to focus on something else, like work. I need to function. I have a family and am responsible for their financial well being. It's not just me in the mix.

Now that I've ripped off the bandage via this blog and self-therapy, I feel discomfort more or less all throughout my day. When I focus on other things, my pain recedes but doesn't disappear. It withdraws into the pit of myself but I always feel it sitting in my belly. It doesn't let me forget it - and I don't want to forget it anymore. It's an important part of me now, a tremendously heavy load that I can't even carry but will try anyway. It makes me a very responsible and sad adult now, who knows that everything will eventually end and that actually, great things aren't possible.

You see, I had ambitions once of being successful. That was part of my artificially constructed personality, sure, but at the very least I wanted to do something interesting and fulfilling in life. Now I know this will never be the case. Avoidants aren't successful if they have to derive that success from or with others. That's not an absolute rule though... J.D. Salinger got famous because he wrote "The Catcher in the Rye." We all know that bookwriting is a solitary affair, and an avoidant like him actually became successful. 

In my own life I tried strenuously to escape my fate but didn't succeed. In high school I had ambitions of becoming an engineer and going to the Naval Academy. Ha ha! I should have known better. By my thirties I started to realize that all my efforts failing or not working out werent't a fluke. I felt that many times, I put more effort in than others and got less results. I resented this but couldn't put it down to anything solid. Was I dumber than others?

Now at least I have the answer to such questions. In the bible there's a famous passage in Genesis that I like to think about. Adam and Eve were thrown out of Eden, which was guarded by a towering angel with a fiery sword. My condition means that I am similarly not allowed to pass that gate like the rest of the humanity, but will always stay outside while others can file straitht through. No one can surpass their own mortal limits. And that's God talking.

All this gives life a shabby and disappointing quality, almost like there's nothing to look forward to. Perhaps that same God who kept me out of paradise should have at least stripped away my ambition so I wouldn't give a shit. Really, there are a lot of people out there with no ambition, who don't want to make anything better of themselves. Why couldn't I have been one them?

It's clear that my condition has robbed me of a life of achievement, and when I finally lay down to die I can at least tell myself that it wasn't my fault. I didn't choose to be this person and my own mortal limits were indeed set very, very low, lower than 99% of people. How can anyone be sad to leave such a disappointing life?
