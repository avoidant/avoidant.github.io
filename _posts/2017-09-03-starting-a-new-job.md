title: Starting a new job
---
I'd been looking for a new job for a while now and had begun to give up hope. Nearly all the companies where I had applied during the past few years had rejected me, and since the jobs were ones for which I was qualified, I began to suspect that I had simply become too old for them.

Then out of the blue some guy contacted me on LinkedIn for a consulting job. He had found my profile wherein I had written (about a past job) that I'd been an instructional designer and trainer. He needed an instructional designer so boom, I got the job with a client of his.

The only problem is, while the instructional designer part was a pleasure to execute, the trainer part of the equation was nearly a traumatic experience. I was much younger and wanted to learn about myself, so I volunteered for the job but soon discovered that my personality disorder is a big fly in the ointment of such ambitions. They threw me into half-sales, half-training situations in front of skeptical audiences. Pretty soon I learned to hate the job, an activity that no one at the organizaton wanted to touch with a 10 foot pole. There was really no way to escape without quitting the company, and they did everything they could to keep me in. I swore to myself that I would never do training again.

Why did I put it on my profile? Because it's a competence and in this world you need to shout about those from the rooftop. Unfortunately, the agency that hired me thinks that I can do it. In my first meeting with them I disclosed that the training part isn't for me. He told me the client wants someone who can do both. Fuck. But the money is too good to pass up.

## First meeting with the client

Actually he also advised me to take a wait and see attitude with the client. It could be they have someone else to do the training part. On Friday I went in to the interview - actually a first meeting since my contract was already approved & signed. The client is a thin and fatigued-looking man who gets stuff done. For a half hour we stood around his chair in the office while he poured out information. I didn't come with a notepad but couldn't have written down anything anyway. I remember most of what he said before he left but he hired me on the spot in this interview/meeting.

I suspect that I will eventually have to stand up in front of groups of 30 or 40 people, and honestly don't know how I'm going to do it. At least the agency guy seems to have some empathy for my plight ("seems," since I have not directly discussed with him what I disclose here).
