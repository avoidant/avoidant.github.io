I'd been looking for a new job for a while now and had begun to give up hope. Nearly all the companies where I had applied during the past few years had rejected me, and since the jobs were ones for which I was qualified, I began to suspect that I had simply become too old.

Then out of the blue some guy contacted me on LinkedIn for a consulting job. He had found my profile wherein I had written (about a past job) that I'd been an instructional designer and trainer. He needed an instructional designer so boom, I got the job with a client of his.

The only problem is, while the instructional designer part is a pleasure to execute, the trainer part of the equation was a traumatic experience in this past job. I was much younger and wanted to learn about myself, so I volunteered for the work but soon discovered that my personality disorder is a big fly in the ointment. They threw me into half-sales, half-training situations in front of skeptical audiences. Pretty soon I learned to hate the job, an activity that no one at the organizaton wanted to touch with a 10 foot pole. There was really no way to escape without quitting the company, and they did everything they could to keep me in. I swore to myself that I would never do training again.

Why did I put it on my profile? Because it's a competence and in this world you need to shout these from the rooftops. Unfortunately, the agency that hired me believes I can do it. In my first meeting with them I disclosed that the training part isn't for me. He told me the client wants someone who can do both. Fuck. But the money is too good to pass up.

## First week on the job

Actually he also advised me to take a wait and see attitude with the client. It could be they have someone else to do the training part, or much if not all of it can be shifted to eLearning. On Friday I went in to the interview - actually a first meeting since my contract was already approved & signed. The client is a thin and fatigued-looking man who gets stuff done. For a half hour we stood around his chair in the office while he poured out information. I didn't come with a notepad but couldn't have written anything anyway. I managed to remember much what he said and mentioned I should come in on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

I suspect that I will eventually have to stand up in front of groups of 30 or 40 people, and honestly don't know how I'm going to do it. At least the agency guy seems to have some empathy for my plight ("seems," since I have not directly discussed with him what I disclose here).

The following week was typical of a consulting experience. Very little briefing (besides the Friday interview) and just getting thrown in to the situation. This is no problem though as I've seen it all before. Exactly ten years ago I began my first job as a consultant and remember that such situations were many times harder. Nowadays I feel more relaxed about my limits and don't feel a need to prove myself. After two days of reading materials on their project file system, I see that I'm being called upon to design a training course for hundreds of people. My God, don't they hire MBAs or people with at least a Masters in Instructional Design for this kind of work?

Luckily I worked at another organization that was going through the same painful transition to new processes exactly ten years ago and my memory still serves me correctly. So that's a plus. As well, if I haven't been doing anything till now to get over my condition, I'm forced at this moment to do so:

- To not care what people think of my appearance or behavior
- To recover quickly from errors and mistakes made (whether social faux pas or wrong answers)
- To understand that life in general, and especially my situation now, is all about getting down to business and not insisting on living in my privileged intellectual bubble
