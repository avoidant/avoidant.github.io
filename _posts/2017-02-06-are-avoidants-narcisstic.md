title: Are avoidants narcisstic?
---
Anyone who's read about avoidant personality disorder to an extent knows there may be a link (however tenuous) between avoidance and narcissism. I've read some accounts claiming that an avoidant is a kind of "inverted" narcissist, who is enraged the world doesn't accord him or her their due attention. 

Sometimes I feel this rings true in myself. Like when I'm writing this blog to understand my feelings. Notice the focus is entirely on my own sufferings, and not what I've done to others. My own brother can attest to the misery I put him through when we were younger. I was often bullied in school so needed to bully someone who was weaker than me.

Just because I'm a deeply wounded avoidant doesn't mean I don't have my own skeletons, and that I feel no shame about the things I've done in real life (as opposed to feeling shame about imaginary traits that I suppose people hate me for).

Furthermore I resort to narcisstic thoughts sometimes, and have caught myself in the past believing I'm smarter or more attractive than I am (and more than others). I engage in this comparative thinking particularly in social situations, when I feel anxiety and am overwhelmed. For these reasons I often say I'm an avoidant "with a streak of narcissism," but I see the narcissism in myself more as a coping mechanism.

## The pull of convention

I grew up with great social pressure to not talk about my issues, but to serve and be selfless. My father in his great authoritative wisdom looked down on the 60s "me generation" and always insisted psychotherapy was all talk and no results. He himself had also served in the armed forces and sought to instill discipline in me from a young age. When I was four or five, he made me memorize the following lines (which I later learned was paraphrased from Tennyson's [The Charge of the Light Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade_(poem)):

> Mine is not to reason why.
Mine is but to do or die.

As a four- and five-year-old, I indeed had behaviorial problems, being diagnosed as "hyperactive" with an inability to sit still. My parents never gave me pills for this, but my father insisted on a new regimen of standing at attention when he spoke and saying "sir." I willingly complied with all this because I appreciated his attention and saw it as a way to get closer to him. 

The hell of all this was, I never outgrew this. Sure, he stopped demanding I act like a soldier later in life. But my compliance in a higher authority is now ingrained, to my own detriment.

## Attracting nacissists

But the idea there's an association with narcissism is more than
