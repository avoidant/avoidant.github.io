Have you ever felt been in a period of your life when you are the most pessimistic ever, and not only feel that everything is against you ("what can go wrong, will"), but that all avenues of hope have been exhausted?

That's where I am now. That consulting job? I've been informed that come January I am out. They will no longer be needing my services, though the agreement would have been till June. I've noticed subtle changes in the client's behavior towards me, and wonder whether he's dismissing me because he's disappointed first, or because he simply doesn't have budget and is rationalizing getting rid of me. Does it matter anyway, when my only source of income is being extirpated?

I hate working there anyway. It's an unorthodox project with an unorthodox client. He's wrestling against great pressures, for sure. But I hate trudging into a place every morning and feeling useless. From day one, I wondered what the hell I was doing there anyway; write a training concept for an SAP project where it's not even clear which software components are being installed? How do you have an idea of what to train people on when the software isn't even ready before day one of the training? I told you this was an unorthodox project.

I guess what's important to mention is my inner emotional state. I feel rotten, and I really mean fucking rotten. When nothing goes my way, when everything and everyone turns against me (mostly anyway), how am I supposed to feel. In the last couple of years - and I don't know exactly when, how, or why - the world slowly turned against me. Whereas, 10 years ago things used to (mostly) go my way it seemed, nowadys I can't even hold down a job despite being more skilled and knowledgeable than ever. All my projects in the past years seemed to end in failure. My relationship with my wife and daughter isn't the best in the world (everyone seems to think being a stepfather is easy when it's actually a damned difficult role).
