title: Why am I ashamed?

  Carrying feelings of shame all my life, even unconsciously perceived, is what
  prevents me from getting better.

When focusing on the constant dull pain inside of me, that is so inaccessible, one thing that seems to put me in touch with it is the realization that I am deeply ashamed of myself. Feeling shame in my case is understandable; I didn't grow up among a bunch of free spirits cavorting through the woods but came out of the South of the 70s. This was a very conservative environment that encouraged conformism above all, and made people (or at least made me) feel ashamed about my differences.

Then there was my father who also came from the South but from an even more conservative background (traditional Southern military culture comes to mind). With all that said about background, today I experience a deep shame in social settings that prevents me from fully exploring or even accessing the majority of my negative feelings. The result is that I carry these around like a giant ball of wax. I've become quite adept at ignoring this "ball" to go about daily business but it's always there and takes up so much energy and effort that when I focus on it and begin to feel some release, I sense that I feel _different_. If that makes any sense. What I mean is, my normal feeling of consciousness now seems more directly connected with my body or whatever, and nothing feels filtered anymore. Anyway I'm going to give up trying to describe this further.

As an example of pervasive shame I need only look no further than writing these words. In a way it's both beneficial and harmless to me to write here on a public blog where (God forbid) someone might come across these pages. But as soon as I perceive what I'm doing, I tend to hide my feelings for fear of retribution and mockery, which makes it all the harder to continue right now.

My feelings of shame are so deep and pervasive within me that I'm sometimes surprised by their intensity. Like today when I go into public I'm suddenly conscious of a dilemma about what I should do about myself. For example, I'll be walking down the street and when I notice other people a part of me is observing their presence in an objective way, while another part is noticing there's something very wrong with the situation, namely, that I am present and am somehow a part of it. When they pass by me I cannot usually bear to look at them or make eye contact, but when I force myself to do so it's excruciating and I constantly try to detect any signs of disgust in their eyes, facial expressions, or body language when they pass me by. I mean, I feel there's something very wrong with me and with my presence among others, so why shouldn't they react in disgust at me?

## The weight of shame (and guilt)

It's incredible the amount of shame I've carried with me my whole life, to the point that if I were to let it all out and fully experience it I may well become debilitated. The big question is how to live with it and still function. A reader may point out that, well, I've been doing it all my life, and they would be correct. But in fact I've managed it by denying its existence, and therefore by denying a part of my life. 

Today I worked from home and felt so tired by all this reflection that I had to take a 30 minute nap. It's so tiring and repetitive to deal with... it never goes away and it constantly reminds me of my unworthiness and makes me insecure in practically every social setting.

At the moment I'm filled with anxiety at the prospect of going to work tomorrow, entering that room packed with others and fighting for a place. As mentioned in previous posts, they've long since stopped making eye contact and perhaps my insecurities make them uncomfortable, which doesn't help my anxiety or shame in the least.
