title: Why am I ashamed?
description: >-
  Carrying feelings of shame all my life, even unconsciously perceived, is what
  prevents me from getting better.

When focusing on the constant dull pain inside of me, that is so inaccessible, one thing that seems to put me in touch with it is the realization that I am deeply ashamed of myself. Feeling shame in my case is understandable; I didn't grow up among a bunch of free spirits cavorting through the woods but came out of the South in the 1970s. This was a very conservative environment that encouraged conformism above all, and made people (or at least made me) feel ashamed about my differences.

Then there was my father who also came from the South but from an even more conservative background (traditional Southern military culture comes to mind). With all that said about background, today I experience a deep shame in social settings that prevents me from fully exploring or even accessing the majority of my negative feelings. The result is that I carry these around like a giant ball of wax. I've become quite adept at ignoring this "ball" to get about with daily business but it's always there and takes up so much energy and effort that when I focus on it and begin to feel some release, I sense that I feel _different_. If that makes any sense. What I mean is, my normal feeling of consciousness now seems more directly connected with my body or whatever, and nothing feels filtered anymore. Anyway I'm going to give up now trying to describe this further.

As an example of pervasive shame I need only look no further than writing these words. In a way it's beneficial and harmless to me to write here on a public blog where (God forbid) someone might come across these pages. But as soon as I perceive what I'm doing, I tend to hide my feelings for fear of retribution and mockery, which makes it all the harder to continue right now.
