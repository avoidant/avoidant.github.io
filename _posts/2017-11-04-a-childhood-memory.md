This past week I've experienced an ever-present dull pain inside of me. The pain is nearly impossible to directly perceive, and resolve, as it's all wrapped up in layers of wax. This state of affairs started at work last week as I really tried to let my guard down among co-workers but when that happens, boy do some difficult perceptions arise. People at work tend to not make eye contact with me, which is a mystery as I cannot see my behavior in a mirror. But I still believe it's now better for me to be real (despite all my flaws) than try to be someone who's not me - which people pick up on anyway.

Maybe people don't make eye contact because of my palpable sense of discomfort. I'd act the same probably, if I had an ill-at-ease and insecure co-worker. My attitudes in the past weeks have also changed. Whereas before, if I saw a successful person I would ask myself why can't I be like that. Nowadays I just tell myself that can never be me; the successful person likely had supportive or semi-supportive parents who didn't neglect their emotions. I'm stunted in that way and will spend the rest of my life clawing back whatever emotional support I can win for myself (through a process of my parent frontal lobes caring for my limbic child).

So from that standpoint the reason I can't be a successful people is I have some pretty heavy issues to deal with, unlike those who are able to focus all their energies on their careers.

## Throwing away Jesus

Growing up I was pretty religious. I prayed every night and served as an altar boy. While never wanting to become a priest later, I appreciated the catholic church for the security it gave me - security about the future especially. But as I grew older I began to realize that God was far more distant from man's affairs than even I had taken for granted. During my childhood I went through a very tough stretch of 4 years (ages 10-13) when I was bullied in school, neglected by my parents, and generally isolated from everyone. The schools I attended changed nearly every year but the same group of dominant bully assholes always seemed to show up (for context, those were the days of desegration when some brilliant liberal administrators decided to socially experiment with children). When middle school started, the change from previous years was even worse. This was almost like a high school, a big, dark place of emptiness where students were expected to stick up for themselves or sink into oblivion. I had to stick up for myself but was clearly one of the beta males, which meant I was noticed by no one and none cared about my fate.

I developed some strategies to cope with these realities. I learned not to show weakness. My father always used to tell me that as a boy when they poured ketchup on a chick, all the other chicks would peck it to death. I guess that was his entire advice for children who have to cope with bullying. I grew ashamed of my feelings of vulnerability (and the culture I grew up in used shame to drill this into us). I also learned to pick on others who were weaker than me. This was a sign of strength, or so I thought. So many times today when I hear of accounts of prisons (and the brutality and loneliness in them) it seems I practically grew up in one.
