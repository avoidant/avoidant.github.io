  Being an avoidant means you carry a lifelong disease. It's not a question of
  getting cured, only of growing your tolerance to the pain and numbness.

One of the biggest issues that makes my disease such a "disaster" is that it evokes intense pain and discomfort in situations that the vast majority of folks might find trivial to confront. Normally we'd say I'm "disabled" or have a "handicap" but unfortunately this isn't recognized as such. One might question why I'm so quiet in a group of strangers; why I'm so reluctant to contribute verbally.

In truth, pain wells up in me in such situations. But that's not the hardest part. As a reaction to the pain, my mind freezes like a creature that senses a predator nearby. The constant nagging and scolding by others who know me ("Why don't you just speak up?") is not a prescription for success. "Unfreezing" the frightened animal is only possible when you go away and leave it alone for the time being.

Thus a mental handicap is born. I've had this problem all my life and don't believe it's going away, no matter how old and experienced I become. Another fact about this issue is that, while it's possible for me to effectively cope (i.e., "open up" to some extent in groups) when the situation is of limited duration like an hour or two, my problem becomes worse if I have to spend more than a day with the group of unknowns.

Such was the situation I recently endured. I indeed brought it on myself - it was my wish for us as a family to visit a yoga retreat. I'd been on such a retreat a few years before and thought the experience was positive in terms of not only becoming relaxed, but meeting others. My wife and daughter both liked the idea and signed up. I decided to understand it as a learning experience and went mainly to register my own reactions and feelings.

## Seeking and finding

By way of introduction I should mention my "secular" beliefs toward the whole yoga/new age theme. I never pursued esoteric movements and beliefs in the hope of achieving nirvana on earth. My frame of mind is more varied and I try to see benefits in all religions and movements. In my view, Buddhism and yoga have a big plus in today's world as they seem to help us cope with never-ending stress and existential questions. My wife has experience with veganism and related movements through a prior relationship, and a former girlfriend introduced me as well to yoga.

That all being said, today I definitely see the therapeutic benefits of it, especially for someone like me who has (for various reasons) lost touch with himself and is unable to function effectively in life.

In contrast to the retreat from a few years ago, this one was far more of a challenge socially. For one thing, all the other participants were young, single people. For another, the hotel facilities were more simple (e.g., communal bathrooms) and were more of a dormitory. If I had gone there to "connect" with people, it was definitely harder to find something in common with a person without so much life experience and who has far different priorities than me. I had of course envisioned an experience like the last, so all this was surprise.

Of course we knew the hosts of the retreat and I more often talked to the husband of the yoga teacher, who is my age. I have to say he's quite open as a person and was willing to listen to me, a fact for which I was grateful. To the others, however, I didn't quite know what to say. While most of the group comprised German and East European females, there were two males there (both of which I would have guessed around 30 or under), who often made funny statements and seemed socially uninhibited. You couldn't find a greater contrast to me in this; I was by far the oldest guest and am definitely quiet and unexciting. 

Writing this brings me closer to my own, old wound: comparing my own sorry state and appearance with younger, more interesting males. I have to admit that compared with them, I don't "have it together" (i.e., currently searching for work and and trying to support a family). But, I know that had I been there age, I would have felt the same as now: useless and unappealing. This is the crux of my problem. In groups I don't appear smart and brilliant, but dumb and slow. In fact, I hate such situations, and the characteristics of this particular group exacerbated my stuggles.

## Closing off

During our free time, my wife sallied forth bravely to the communal rooms to make contact with people while I stayed in the room. Yoga has always been a demanding exercise for me and though I slept tolerably well at the hotel, fatigue was still a factor. But on the other hand, my wife has a habit of abandoning me when we're with strangers to go off to do something or to talk with someone, leaving me to dangle and fend for myself. I have no idea why she does this (could it that in South America this is standard behavior?), especially knowing my condition, but if our weaknesses were reversed, I would never do this to her.

Knowing this would happen was a further reason why I stayed in the room (with my daughter, who was bored with a bunch of older people). I have to say, I am ashamed of myself and who I am. Imagining the common question about my profession, I didn't even know what I would say. What I do sounds incredibly boring and seldom evokes interest in conversations with strangers. On top of that I'm jobless and growing more desperate by the month. If anything, the young people there seemed like a smart and determined lot, which seemed intimidating.

My standard behavior in such intensely uncomfortable situations is to not make eye contact but to only focus on what I'm doing or with whom I'm talking. I imagine this behavior puts a lot of people off, which is kind of what I want. A major issue though is that I cannot think of anything to say when meeting strangers. For instance, a woman on the next yoga mat seemed reluctant to make eye contact as well but talked freely with my wife and daughter. When I made a remark to her at an opportune moment, she seemed reluctant to engage in conversation.
