I have a real problem with being old and unsuccessful, though I see both as natural consequences. Actually, I have no problem with either of these on some level, but unfortunately I'm dependent on my own abilities to make a living. 

It's funny however that, although I feel this way today, I've always had a problem with myself - even when I was young and one couldn't deem me as unsuccessful yet. All this has contributed to my loss of knowing who I am, because confronting my self is painful.

## Falling from 35,000 feet

Yesterday I read a bizarre article about how to survive falling out of a jetliner at cruising altitude. It's not one of your typical experiences, mind you, but it's one of the scariest thought experiments I can imagine. The chances I will undergo such an experience is nearly nill, as well as my chances of surviving (think of MH 17). Nevertheless, the article, which seemed authoritative enough, gave tips on both what to do and what to avoid during the long fall. At the end is a description of the final impact, where your rate of fall is _only_ 120 mph.

This article stayed with me literally the entire day. Perhaps it's because I similarly feel that I'm in a death dive in my life. When I look at my way of thinking and how it's hampered me, endangering my relationships and career chances, it's really unclear where I'll be in the 10 years.

I've nearly reached the point of impact. Like one guy mentioned in the article, a tail gunner or pilot in a bomber blown up in WWII, I've smoked my cigarette on the way down, admiring the scenery in contemplative thought. My experience of falling and final impact is not only lonely, but it was initiated by violence (somehow). Above all it was simply not supposed to happen.

And yet here I am. According to the article, you might survive if one of a couple of things happens: you land in plush, deep snow; you land on a tree exactly where the branches radiate from the trunk (and not on the trunk itself or too far out on the branches); you are able to successfully execute the skydiver's five-point landing and roll.

I have something confess though. For me, impact has not only to do with being splattered in a gooey mess on the pavement. It's also my final reckoning, which has nothing to do with physical survivability. Impact and death are how I equate finding my identity.

## Gone but not forgotten

Once upon a time, when I was young and naive, I went to a psychoanalyst who used outdated and ill-fated techniques to ferret out my core issues. This analyst was of the opinion that I had lost something valuable long ago. At the time, I understood this to mean either my "mother figure" who abandoned me in childhood, my own identity, or both (I had to supply this reasoning since I was paying her too much to tell me the answers).

If she meant "my identity" then I must agree with her. Today it's simply too painful and exhausting to try to understand who I am, and the exercise is downright intolerable in social situations. Nevertheless it's there. As in, despite being scary and unknown and covered in blood, it does exist. I know because every day it reminds me of this.
