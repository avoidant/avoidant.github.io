title: Are you the body you wear?
description: >-
  Many take a centered feeling of being squarely in one's body for granted. For
  me, it's a struggle in accepting a negative perception of self.

Last Sunday a friend invited us to an art exposition. It was halfway across town and took place in the small attic floor of an apartment building. I don't really pay attention to art anymore (after having had deeper interest when in my 20s) but went in order to appease my wife. There's much more interesting things to see - how about an exposition about the Celts in Europe? But good; art _can_ be interesting; it's just that so much of it is meaningless (or humorous) these days, i.e., it doesn't really evoke any strong feelings one way or another.

Since my realization last week about the true nature of my deeper issues of self stemming from childhood emotional neglect, and the newfound need to take a more parental view towards my own inner discomfort and feelings, I decided that during all such social situations - like going to an art exhibition taking place in a small room with a handful of strangers whom I have nothing in common with - I will henceforth let my inner feelings express themselves rather than hold them at bay (as I've been doing for nearly all my life).

This is of course far, far easier said or intended than done. Having the rest of my life in order to learn to be inside my own skin doesn't detract from the extreme difficulty of attempting to not defend against one's feelings - when it's all I've ever done for nearly half a century.

## Inside the exposition

The small room was painted white and it doubled as the atelier of the artist. Inside stood all her small objects, items taken from nature, either from the forest (parts of wooden tree trunks or branches) or smoothly carved marble stones. The objects were quite attractive and if I were a wealthy person and had space, I might have purchased one.

Standing around the room were other visitors. They were generally much older than me and spoke with each other and sipped wine. My wife and our friend knew some people scattered off, leaving me alone. I moved among the pieces and stood beside a few, examining them. I was self-conscious, especially when I questioned whether I really belonged there, with those people. I exchanged a few words with the artist, asking the obvious questions about her process for creating the objects. But most of the time I was alone. I couldn't go up to anyone and strike up a conversation because I felt I had nothing in common with them. Indeed many were artists themselves, and it's just not my world.

Suddenly I started losing confidence as I came to these realizations. A dark feeling of worthlessness emerged; it had a physical quality, almost as if I were wounded. Although I can't see myself, I must be giving off an aura of low confidence because I sense it in others as they interact with me. It's all about my poor body, my poor body that was denied and denied the possibility to express its natural feelings, that gives me so much trouble today. At times I feel tears well up in my eyes and at such moments I just can't let it happen. What will others think as they see my misty eyed as I walk among them?

## What will others think?

This is the key question, the one that prevents me from being myself and finally getting over this goddamned dilemma. At work for instance I notice that now people avoid eye contact with me and keep their distance. How am I to deal with this, especially when I need to accept myself at this crucial stage in my life? And what does it mean? Do they judge me completely negatively, or only a part of me? For sure, I'm not a happy camper there. My assignment sucks and is almost doomed to failure (conditions for success clearly don't exist). And now, especially at this phase of my life, I struggle intensely to understand myself and just be a better me, discovering slowly that I may not be the person I thought I was.
