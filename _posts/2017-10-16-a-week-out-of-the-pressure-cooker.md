  An unproductive week away from one's environment doesn't necessarily lead to

A week away from work and on vacation with the family doesn't necessarily lead to more healing or realizations. In my case it mostly leads to non-resolution of core issues. There are both external and internal distractions. My wife has certain characteristics, like a strong personality, in which she constantly makes herself heard. My daughter and I get along and I would say our relationship always emerges stronger somehow after the time together (my work and her academically demanding school generally causes us to drift apart more).

However this didn't prevent me from making a few observations. First, and as I sit here writing this, I realize that non-resolution generally leads to greater reluctance to face pain. Tomorrow I head back into the pressure cooker and feel unprepared. This is generally the opposite of what one expects from a so-called nice, relaxing vacation.

Secondly, the painful feelings that go parabolic in intensity when I'm around others (particular those I don't know so well) seem to be (as sometimes perceived) related to the need for social reassurance; hey, I'm ok and others know and accept this. Thing is, I'm lacking this most basic trait of self-reassurance that most people seem to have. You, the reader, probably have this and don't realize it. So how come I'm missing this? The most obvious answer points to my perpetually emotionally cold parents. I was around my mother a lot in my very younger years so she surely paid attention to me, but something happened whose effects I only feel today.

Even now it's hard to focus on the pain and my mind purposely avoids it. It's what Dr. Sandra Parker called "chronic abandonment issues." She said some resort to the bottle, others drugs, and yet others overwork, etc. My avoidance is none of those things. It's good, clean out-of-body experiences and numbness. I don't hover on the ceiling above my body (or anything like that). Instead, to deal with painful sensations and even consequences of what's inside, I "swallow" it (like Uranus swallowing his children). The reward is numbness but a vague feeling something's not quite right.

She (Dr. Parker) rightly said that most people with my condition have two choices (Buddhists "love or hate"), whereby they either ignore the pain but live with the numbness and lesser pain of denial and ignorance, or they face the excruciating feelings of the truth about themselves. The latter option is harder, but leads to (some) resolution, whereby the former strategy leads to a life of pain but no resolution.

## What's my truth?

I wish I knew. Even touching on the edge of the pain causes my mind to jump out of it again to find distraction.
